VNIME - Vietnamese IME for Windows
==================================

Since early in my Vietnamese studies, the following things have bugged me:
* The most-common Vietnamese IME, [UniKey](https://unikey.vn/vietnam/)
** runs as a separate application instead of a Windows IME
** needs [special effort](https://www.unikey.org/en/autostart-admin.html) to work in Admin-level applications
** is closed source, although [older versions](https://www.unikey.org/en/source.html) area available under the GPL
* The MS Windows built-in IME only supports [a Windows-specific variant of VNI](http://winvnkey.sourceforge.net/download-winvnkey-and-type-vietnamese.htm#Typing_method_Microsoft) instead of the default-on-all-other-platforms [TELEX](http://winvnkey.sourceforge.net/download-winvnkey-and-type-vietnamese.htm#Typing_method_Telex)

This project is my attempt to create a simple, UI-less TELEX IME for Windows, using the Windows [Text Services Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/tsf/text-services-framework).

It's also my chance to play with the modern projection of the Windows API, [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt).
